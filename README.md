# Asteroids (Boot.dev Edition)

This is a stripped down version of Asteroids to complete the Boot.dev project, "Build Asteroids using Python and Pygame"

Here are some more things to do to round this out:
 - Add a scoring system
 - Implement multiple lives and respawning
 - Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
 - Add acceleration to the player movement
 - Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
 - Add a background image
 - Create different weapon types
 - Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
 - Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a round one
 - Add a shield power-up
 - Add bombs that can be dropped
 
And here are evem more to make it like the classical game:
 - Add pew pew sounds
 - Make the shots much smaller
 - Add flying saucers that also shoot
